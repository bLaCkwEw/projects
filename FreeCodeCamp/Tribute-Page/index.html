                Invincible is the son of Omni-Man, an extraterrestrial superhero
                of the Viltrumite race. Invincible inherited his father's complete array of super powers and he has
                sworn to
                protect the Earth. As a teenager, he had trouble adjusting to his newfound powers and coping with the
                reality of
                his origins. Invincible is voiced by Patrick Cavanaugh in the 2008 motion comic series, and by Steven
                Yeun
                in
                the 2021 television series.
